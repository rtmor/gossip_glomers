0	:invoke	:read	nil
0	:info	:read	nil	indeterminate: Malformed RPC response. Maelstrom sent node n0 the following request:

{:type "read", :msg_id 1}

And expected a response of the form:

{:type (eq "read_ok"),
 :messages [Any],
 {:k :msg_id} Int,
 :in_reply_to Int}

... but instead received

{:in_reply_to 1, :messages {}, :type "read_ok"}

This is malformed because:

{:messages (not (sequential? {}))}

See doc/protocol.md for more guidance.
